# Angello Lite
#### An introductory version of [Angello](https://github.com/angularjs-in-action/angello), the app built in the book [AngularJS in Action](http://www.manning.com/bford/).


## Prerequisites
You'll need [`git`](http://git-scm.com/) and a web browser.


## Getting it
Run the following command to check out a local copy of the code.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/angularjs-in-action/angello-lite.git
```


## Running it
Because we are pulling files from a CDN, we are going to need to run Angello Lite from a web server. There are a few ways to do this, but one of the easiest ways is to use the npm package `serve`.

The steps are as follows:

1. Install Node.js. You can find all of the information to do that [here](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Install the `serve` package by running `npm install -g serve` from the command line.
3. Navigate to the `angello-lite` directory from the command line and run `serve`.
4. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
